    <li>🟦 Hold your breath for the second side (4 seconds)</li>
    <li>🟥 Exhale as you draw the third (4 seconds)</li>

  </ul>

  <div class="square-box">

    <li>Oxygen regulation balances stress hormones</li>
    <li>Mindfulness brings awareness to the present</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2. Progressive Muscle Relaxation</h3>
